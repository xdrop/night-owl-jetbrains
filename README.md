<h1>Night Owl</h1>

> Night owl *theme* and *colour scheme* for IntelliJ®, Webstorm® and other Jetbrains® IDEs :jack_o_lantern:
</div>

Adaption of [Sarah Drasner's Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) VSCode theme for Webstorm® and IntelliJ® based on [Material UI Jetbrains](https://github.com/ChrisRM/material-theme-jetbrains) and [Rainbow Brackets](https://github.com/izhangzhihao/intellij-rainbow-brackets). Due to the *syntax highlighting* for Jetbrains® IDE's being slightly different, the highlighting won't 100% reproduce that of the VS Code plugin, but it's very similar. You can [vote](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEABKL-5473) to help with this.
